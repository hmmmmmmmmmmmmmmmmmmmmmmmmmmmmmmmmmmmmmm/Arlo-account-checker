# Arlo-account-checker
Checks if account credentials are registered on arlo.com. The main purpose of a tool like this is to check if breached users have reused the same credentials on other services; in this case [arlo.com](https://www.arlo.com).

## Usage
1) Install the [CPR](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr) and [JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library â€” [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) is a great package manager.
2) Paste account credentials in `combos.txt` with the `email:password` format seperated by newline characters.
4) Compile, and run!
